# Pairs-Trading

Pairs Trading is a market-neutral trading strategy which involves matching a long position with a short position in two securities which have a high level of positive cointegration. It is a form of statistical arbitrage i.e it looks at the relative price movement between the two securities.

As it is a market-neutral strategy, it is independent of the trend being followed by the overall market (upwards or downwards or sideways). Instead, pairs trading works on the concept of mean-reversion. When two highly cointegrated securites deviate from their general trend, it is expected that they will return back to that trend in the future.

The spread between the stock prices created during the deviation serves as an opportunity for profit. One can open a long position on the stock expected to move upwards and a short position on the stock expected to move downwards. If the pair performs as expected, it is a profitable trade.

Even if the pair does not perform as expected, the trader will be able to mitigate some portion of their losses as the loss on one security will be offset by the profits on the other security. Hence, pairs trading also acts as a form of hedging and can be used to minimise losses.
